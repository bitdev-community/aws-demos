A basic AWS Lambda function component

## Running locally

Run the Lambda using the app name set on `http-lambda.lambda.ts`:

```
bit run hello-lambda
```

You should see a message in the console like the following:

```sh
hello-lambda-app app is running on http://localhost:3000
```

To test your lambda function, you can make a POST request to the URL where it is running.
To test an event, pass it to the body of the request:

```sh
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "event":{
      requestContext: {
        http: {
          method: 'GET',
          path: 'api/hello'
        }
      }
    }
}'
```

Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    "body": "{\"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"api/hello\"}"
  }
}
```

## Deploy the Lambda function to AWS

Make sure to configure `deployOptions` within your Lambda as shown below. It is recommended to store your credentials in environment variables.

```ts
 deployOptions: {
    clientConfig: {
      /* the aws hosting region */
      region: 'us-east-1',
      /* your aws credentials */
      credentials: {
        secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_KEY,
        accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
      },
    },
```

Once done, your component would be deployed on your next tag:

```
bit tag -m "Deploy Lambda"
```

Visit your AWS console and you will see the Lambda function deployed.

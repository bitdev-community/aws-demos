The Lambda provides a component-driven experience for composing, building and deploying [AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

## Basic usage

To get a Lambda function running in your workspace, you can either import it or install as package into your workspace.

```
bit import aws-lambda.app-types/lambda
```

or

```
bit install @aws-lambda/app-types.lambda
```

Then configure the new Lambda component on your [workspace.json](https://bit.dev/teambit/workspace/content/workspace-configuration/~compositions) by adding your component to the root level:

```json
"aws-lambda.app-type/lambda": {}
```

Check the following examples to see how to use the Lambda app type in your applications.

1. [simple-lamda](https://bit.cloud/aws-lambda/demos/simple-lambda)
2. [http-lamda](https://bit.cloud/aws-lambda/demos/http-lambda)

## Deploy the lambda function to AWS

AWS Lambda is set in an [app plugin](https://bit.dev/apps/app-plugin)file ending with the `lambda.*` suffix as [seen in this example](https://bit.dev/learnbit/apps/aws/lambda/simple-lambda/~code/simple-lambda.lambda.ts).
Make sure to configure `deployOptions` within your Lambda as following:
It is recommended to store your credentials in environment variables.

```ts
export const YourLambdaApp: LambdaApp = {
  /* the app's name (for Bit) */
  name: "your-lambda",
  /* an entry point for the app's build */
  entry: require.resolve("./your-lambda.handler"),
  /* your aws host config and credentials */
  deployOptions: {
    clientConfig: {
      /* the hosting region */
      region: "us-east-1",
      /* your aws credentials */
      credentials: {
        accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
        secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      },
    },
    /* the lambda's name (for aws). Using an already used name will update the code. */
    functionName: `your_lambda`,
    /* the runtime execution environment */
    runtime: "nodejs14.x",
    /* a description for your lambda (will be displayed on the aws console) */
    description: "Deployed from Bit Component",
    /* the name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to execute your function */
    handlerName: "handler",
    /* Optional: lambda endpoint url configurations.  */
    urlOptions: {
      authType: 'NONE',
      invokeMode: 'BUFFERED',
      cors: {
        allowOrigins: ['*'],
        allowMethods: ['GET']
      }
    },
  },
  /* the port range for running the app (lambda) in development (bit run) */
  portRange: [3000, 5000],
};
```

Once done, your component would be deployed on your next tag:

```
bit tag aws/lambda/simple-lambda
```

Visit your AWS console and you will see the Lambda function deployed.

### Compose your own Lambda env

The Lambda provides an entire development environment crafted for development and deployment of Lambda functions.
To create a customized development environment for Lambda functions, fork and modify the following example component:

```
bit fork teambit.cloud-providers/aws/lambda
```
